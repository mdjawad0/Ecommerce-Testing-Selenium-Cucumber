# Ecommerce-Testing-Selenium-Cucumber
Functional testing of an e-commerce web application using Selenium and Cucumber.

The ecomm is a static web application with various components and pages that include HTML, CSS, and JS files.

We will be testing this web application using Selenium classes and Cucumber step definitions.

The ecomm web application must be deployed on the Apache Tomcat server by copying and pasting the entire folder into Apache's **/var/www/html/** path, which will host the app at **localhost:80/ecomm**.

Import the Selenium project, which requires the TestNG plugin, which can be installed from the Eclipse marketplace, and run the **Test1.java** class, which will open the Ecomm contact.html page and accept the alert message.

Then, import the Cucumber project, which requires the Cucumber plugin, which can be installed from the Eclipse marketplace, and run the **AddtoCart** feature file, which will open the cart and submit the form with user details.
